# Spring Boot application template

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/spring-boot-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/spring-boot-template)

## Purpose

The purpose of this template is used by Backstage to demo Spotify's [Golden Path](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/17/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/) 
concept for SpringBoot based applications within HMCTS and help to keep the same standards across multiple teams. 
If you need to create a new app, you can simply go to [Backstage portal](https://backstage.hmcts.net/).

## What's inside

The template is a working application with a minimal setup. It contains:
 * application skeleton
 * setup script to prepare project
 * common plugins and libraries
 * docker setup
 * swagger configuration for api documentation ([see how to publish your api documentation to shared repository](https://github.com/hmcts/reform-api-docs#publish-swagger-docs))
 * code quality tools already set up
 * integration with GitHub actions
 * MIT license and contribution information
 * Helm chart using chart-java.

The application exposes health endpoint (http://localhost:4550/health) and metrics endpoint
(http://localhost:4550/metrics).

The template contains the following plugins:

  * checkstyle

    You can create the report by running the following command:

    ```bash
      ./gradlew jacocoTestReport

    of known vulnerable components that are included in the build. To run it
